    "# Deploying a Seq2Seq Model with the Hybrid Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk through the process of transitioning a sequence-to-sequence model to Torch Script using PyTorch's Hybrid Frontend. The model that we will convert is the chatbot model from the [Chatbot tutorial](). While the [introductory Hybrid Frontend tutorials]() are useful for gaining an understanding of the work-flow, purpose, and basic syntax of the feature, this document covers a more challenging model and a more practical use-case. You can either treat this tutorial as a \"Part 2\" to the [Chatbot tutorial]() and deploy your own pretrained model, or you can start with this document and use a pretrained model that we host. In the latter case, you can reference the original [Chatbot tutorial]() for details regarding data preprocessing, model theory and definition, and model training.\n",

    "## What is the Hybrid Frontend?\n",
    "During the research and development phase of a deep learning-based project, it is adventagous to interact with an **eager**, imperative interface like PyTorch's. This gives users the ability to write familiar idiomatic Python that executes as-is, allowing for the use of Python data structures, control flow operations, print statements, and debugging utilities. Although the eager interface is an advantageous tool for R&D applications, when it comes time to deploy the model in a production environment, having a **graph**-based model representation is very beneficial. A deferred graph representation allows for numerous optimization techniques such as out-of-order execution, framework-agnostic model exportation with ONNX, and the ability to target highly optimized hardware architectures. PyTorch provides mechanisms for incrementally converting eager-mode code into Torch Script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hybrid Frontend is faciliated through a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler (`torch.jit`). The JIT compiler has two core modalities for converting an eager model to a graph representation: **tracing** and **scripting**. The `torch.jit.trace` function takes a module or function and an example input. It then runs the example input through the function or module while tracing the computational steps that are encountered, and outputs a graph-based function that performs the traced actions. **Tracing** is great for straightforward modules and functions that do not involve data-dependent control flow. However, if a function with data-dependent if statements and loops is traced, only the operations called along the execution route taken by the example input will be recorded. In other words, the control flow itself is not captured. To convert modules and functions containing data-dependent control flow, a **scripting** mechanism is provided. Scripting explicitly converts the module or function code to Torch Script, including all possible control flow routes. To use script mode, simply add a `torch.jit.script` decorator to your Python function or a `torch.jit.script_method` decorator to your module's methods. The one caveat with using scripting is that it only supports a restricted subset of Python. Features such as generators, defs, and Python data structures are not supported. To remedy this, you can invoke traced modules from scripted modules (and vice-versa), and you can call pure Python functions and modules from scripted modules. However, the operations done in the pure Python functions will not be exportable.\n",

    "## Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, the model that we are using is a [sequence-to-sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) (seq2seq) model. This type of model is used in cases when our input is a variable-length sequence, and our output is also a variable length sequence that is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping of the input. A seq2seq model is comprised of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that work cooperatively: an **encoder** and a **decoder**.\n",

    "### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder RNN iterates through the input sentence one word at a time, at each time step outputting an \"output\" vector and a hidden state that is used in the next time step. Essentially, the encoder takes the input sequence, and attempts to encode its \"meaning\" to a fixed-sized context or \"thought\" tensor. In our case, the context tensor is simply the output of the RNN, or the output features of the last hidden layer in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder RNN generates the response sentence in a word-by-word fashion. It uses the encoder's context tensor, and a previous word to generate the next word in the sequence. It continues generating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end of the sentence. In practice, relying soley on the encoder's context tensor to encode the meaning of the entire sequence is not very effective, especially when encoding long input sequences. To remedy this, we use an [attention mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) in our decoder. This attention mechanism helps the decoder to \"pay attention\" to certain parts of the input when generating the output. For our model, we implement [Luong et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)'s \"Global attention\" module, and use it as a layer in our decode model."

    "## Define Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement our encoder's RNN with the `torch.nn.GRU` module which we feed an entire batch of sentences (word embeddings) and it internally iterates through the sequences one word at a time calculating the hidden states. We initialize this module to be bidirectional, meaning that we have two independent GRUs: one that iterates through the sequences in chronological order, and another that iterates in reverse order. We ultimately return the sum of these models' outputs. Since our model was trained using batching, our `EncoderRNN` model's `forward` function expects a padded input batch. To batch variable-length sentences, we allow a maximum of *MAX_LENGTH* words in a sentence, and all sentences in the batch that have less than *MAX_LENGTH* words are padded at the end with our dedicated *PAD_token* tokens. To use padded batches with a PyTorch RNN module, we must wrap the forward pass call with `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` and `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence` data transformations. Note that the `forward` function also takes an `input_lengths` list, which contains the length of each sentence in the batch. This input is used by the `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` function when padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Frontend Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the encoder's `forward` function does not contain any data-dependent control flow, we will use the **tracing** to convert it to script mode. When tracing a module, we can leave the module definition as-is, as we perform the trace upon initialization. We will initialize all models towards the end of this document before we run evaluations."

    "As in the chatbot tutorial, we use a `GreedySearchDecoder` module to facilitate the actual decoding process. This module has the trained encoder and decoder models as attributes, and drives the process of encoding an input sentence (a vector of word indexes), and iteratively decoding an output response sequence one word (word index) at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding the input sequence is straightforward: simply forward the entire sequence tensor and its corresponding lengths vector to the `encoder`. It is important to note that this module only deals with one input sequence at a time, **NOT** batches of sequences. Therefore, when the constant **1** is used for declaring tensor sizes, this corresponds to a batch size of 1. To decode a given decoder output, we must iteratively run forward passes through our decoder model, which outputs softmax scores corresponding to the probability of each word being the correct next word in the decoded sequence. We initialize the `decoder_input` to a tensor containing an *SOS_token*. After each pass through the `decoder`, we *greedily* append the word with the highest softmax probability to the `decoded_words` list. We also use this word as the `decoder_input` for the next iteration. The decoding process terminates either if the `decoded_words` list has reached a length of *MAX_LENGTH* or if the predicted word is the *EOS_token*.\n",

    "The `forward` method of this module involves iterating over the range of $[0, max\\_length)$ when decoding an output sequence one word at a time. Because of this, we should use **scripting** to convert this module to Torch Script. Unlike with our encoder and decoder models, which we can trace, we must make some necessary changes to the `GreedySearchDecoder` module in order to initialize an object without error. In other words, we must ensure that our module adheres to the rules of the scripting mechanism, and does not utilize any language features outside of the subset of Python that Torch Script includes.\n",

    "- `nn.Module` -> `torch.jit.ScriptModule`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In order to use PyTorch's scripting mechanism on a module, that module must inherit from the `torch.jit.ScriptModule`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Added `decoder_n_layers` to the constructor arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This change stems from the fact that the encoder and decoder models that we pass to this module will be a child of `TracedModule` (not `Module`). Therefore, we cannot access the decoder's number of layers with `decoder.n_layers`. Instead, we plan for this, and pass this value in during module construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store away new attributes as constants\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the original implementation, we were free to use variables from the surrounding (global) scope in our `GreedySearchDecoder`'s `forward` method. However, now that we are using scripting, we do not have this freedom. An easy solution to this is to store these values from the global scope as attributes to the module in the constructor, and add them to a special list called `__constants__` so that they can be used as literal values when constructing the graph in the `forward` method. An example of this usage is on NEW line 19, where instead of using the `device` and `SOS_token` global values, we use our constant attributes `self._device` and `self._SOS_token`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add the `torch.jit.script_method` decorator to the `forward` method\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Adding this decorator lets the JIT compiler know that the function that it is decorating should be scripted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Enforce types of `forward` method arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By default, all parameters to a Torch Script function are assumed to be Tensor. If we need to pass an argument of a different type, we can use function type annotations as introduced in [PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/). In addition, it is possible to declare arguments of different types using MyPy-style type annotations (see [doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html#types)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change initialization of `decoder_input`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the original implementation, we initialized our `decoder_input` tensor with `torch.LongTensor([[SOS_token]])`. When scripting, we are not allowed to initialize tensors in a literal fashion like this. Instead, we can initialize our tensor with an explicit torch function such as `torch.ones`. In this case, we can easily replicate the scalar `decoder_input` tensor by multiplying 1 by our SOS_token value stored in the constant `self._SOS_token`.\n"

    "Next, we define some functions for evaluating an input. The `evaluate` function takes a normalized string sentence, processes it to a tensor of its corresponding word indexes  (with batch size of 1), and passes this tensor to a `GreedySearchDecoder` instance called `searcher` to handle the encoding/decoding process. The searcher returns the output word index vector and a scores tensor corresponding to the softmax scores for each decoded word token. The final step is to convert each word index back to its string representation using `voc.index2word`.\n",

    "## Convert Model to Torch Script\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, to convert the encoder model to Torch Script, we use **tracing**. Tracing any module requires running an example input through the model's `forward` method and trace the computational graph that the data encounters. The encoder model takes an input sequence and a corresponding lengths tensor. Therefore, we create an example input sequence tensor `test_seq`, which is of appropriate size (MAX_LENGTH, 1), contains numbers in the appropriate range $[0, voc.num\\_words)$, and is of the appropriate type (int64). We also create a `test_seq_length` scalar which realistically contains the value corresponding to how many words are in the `test_seq`. The next step is to use the `torch.jit.trace` function to trace the model. Notice that the first argument we pass is the module that we want to trace, and the second is a tuple of arguments to the module's `forward` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform the same process for tracing the decoder as we did for the encoder. Notice that we call forward on a set of random inputs to the traced_encoder to get the output that we need for the decoder. This is not required, as we could also simply create a tensor of the correct shape, type, and value range. We trace the model in the exact fashion that we traced the encoder.\n",

    "### GreedySearchDecoder\n",

    "Recall that we scripted our searcher module due to the presence of data-dependent control flow. In the case of scripting, we do the conversion work up front by adding the decorator and making sure the implementation complies with scripting rules.
