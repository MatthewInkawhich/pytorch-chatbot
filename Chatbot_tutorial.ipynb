    "In this tutorial, we explore a fun and interesting use-case of recurrent sequence-to-sequence models. We will train a simple chatbot using movie scripts contained in the [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). \n",

    "Conversational models are a hot topic in artificial intelligence research. Chatbots can be found in a variety of settings, including customer service applications and online helpdesks. These bots are often powered by retrieval-based models, which have predefined responses to questions of a certain form. In a highly restricted domain like a company's IT helpdesk, these models may be sufficient, however, they are not robust enough for more general use-cases. Teaching a machine to carry out a meaningful conversation with a human in multiple domains is a research question that is far from solved. Recently, the deep learning boom has allowed for powerful generative models like Google's [Neural Conversational Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869), which marks a large step towards multi-domain generative conversational models. In this tutorial, we will implement this kind of model in PyTorch.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although we have spent a great effort preparing and massaging our data into a nice vocabulary object and list of sentence pairs, our models will ultimately expect numerical torch.tensors as inputs. One way to prepare the processed data for the models can be found in the [seq2seq translation tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html). In this tutorial, we use a batch size of 1, meaning that all we have to do is convert the words in our sentence pairs to their corresponding indexes from the vocabulary and feed this to the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you're interested in speeding up training and/or would like to leverage GPU parallelization capabilities, we will need to train with mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using minibatches also means that we must be mindful of the variation of sentence length. To accomodate sentences of different sizes in the same batch, we will make our batched input tensor of shape *(max_length, batch_size)*, where sentences shorter than the *max_length* are zero padded after an *EOS_token*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simply convert our English sentences to tensors by converting words to their indexes(`indexesFromSentence`) and zero-pad, our tensor would have shape *(batch_size, max_length)* and indexing the first dimension would return a full sequence across one batch. However, we need to be able to index our batch along time, and across all batches. Therefore, we transpose our input batch shape to *(max_length, batch_size)*, so that indexing across the first dimension returns a time step across batches, which is exactly what we want when training our batch of sentences. We handle this transpose implicitly in the `zeroPadding` function. \n",

    "![batches](images/seq2seq_batches.png)\n",

    "The `inputVar` function handles the process of converting sentences to tensor, ultimately creating a correctly shaped zero-padded tensor. It also returns a list of lengths for each of the sequences in the batch which will be passed to our decoder later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `outputVar` function performs a similar function to `inputVar`, but instead of returning a `lengths` list, it returns binary mask tensor and a maximum target sentence length. The binary mask tensor has the same shape as the output target tensor, but every element that is a *PAD_token* is 0 and all others are 1.\n",

This is especially the case when dealing with long input sequences, greatly limiting the capability of our decoder.\n",

Another difference is that with \"Global attention\", we calculate attention weights, or energies, using the hidden state of the decoder from the current time step only. Bahdanau et al.'s attention calculation requires knowledge of the decoder's state from the previous time step. Also, Luong et al. provides various methods to calculate the attention energies between the encoder output and decoder output which are called \"score functions\":\n",

This means that at some probability, set by `teacher_forcing_ratio`, we use the current target word as the decoder's next input rather than using the decoder's current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we are setting the `teacher_forcing_ratio`, and not be fooled by fast convergence.\n",

We use the `GRU` layer like this in the `encoder`. The reality is that under the hood, there is an iterative process looping over each time step calculating hidden states. Alternatively, you ran run these modules one time step (word) at a time. In this case, we manually loop over the sequence during the training process like we do for the `decoder` model. As long as you maintain the correct conceptual model of these modules, implementing sequential models can be very straightforward.</p></div>"

We first format the sentence as an input batch of word indexes with *batch_size=1*. Next, we forward the input batch through the encoder, and similarly to our `train` function, we then prepare the encoder's final hidden layer to be the initial hidden layer of the decoder. If *beam_size == 1*, we use greedy decoding, otherwise we use beam decoding.\n",

After typing our input sentence and pressing *Enter*, our text is normalized in the same way as our training data, and is ultimately fed to the `evaluate` function to obtain a decoded output sentence. We format the outputs of our greedy decoder and beam decoder differently, as we want to show the top *beam_size* sentences along with their corresponding average word scores. We loop this process, so we can keep chatting with our bot until we enter either \"q\" or \"quit\".\n",
